# Zachary Truong's GitHub Portfolio - Library

The library webpage displays all available books in the local database (using local Web API).

## Add book to the library

To add a book to the library:

- Click "ADD" button.
- Fill out the title of the book.
- Provide the full URL of the book cover.
- Choose a reading status of the book (READ or UNREAD).
- Click "Submit" button to save book to the local database, then the webpage will reload to show the newly added book.

## Change the reading status of the book

Each book has a status button to show if you have read or not read that book. To change the status of that book by clicking on that button, it will change the reading status of the book ub the local database as well as the DOM.

## Remove book from the library

Each book has a remove button to remove itself from the local database, then the DOM will reload to display the updated library.
